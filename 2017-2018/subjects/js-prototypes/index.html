# JavaScript Prototypes

Learn how JavaScript prototypal inheritance works, how to make class-like structures from it, and the basics of the new classes added in ES6.

This material is used in [COMEM+](http://www.heig-vd.ch/comem) [web development courses](https://github.com/MediaComem/comem-webdev).


**You will need**

* [Google Chrome][chrome] (recommended, any browser with developer tools will do)

**Recommended reading**

* [JavaScript](../js/)

### ES5 has no support for **classes**

TODO: ES6 classes

There are 3 ways to create objects.

```js
// Create an object with a literal
var person = {
  firstName: "olivier",
  lastName: "liechti"
};

// Create an object with a prototype
var child = Object.create(person);

// Create an object with a constructor
var child = new Person("olivier", "liechti");
```

* **class** is a reserved word in JavaScript, but it is not used in the current version of the language (reserved for the future).
* A **constructor** is a function like any other (uppercase is a coding convention).
* It is the use of the **new** keyword that triggers the object creation process.



---
### Every object **inherits** from a **prototype** object

TODO: add graph

```js
// Prints "Skywalker" on the console
console.log(child.lastName);
```

* Every object inherits from a prototype object. It **inherits and can override** its properties, including its methods.
* Objects created with object literals inherit from **Object.prototype**.
* When you access the property of an object, JavaScript **looks up the prototype chain** until it finds an ancestor that has a value for this property.

* [Symbols][js-symbol]

  The data type "symbol" is a primitive data type having the quality that values of this type can be used to make object properties that are anonymous.
  Every symbol value returned from Symbol() is unique.  A symbol value may be used as an identifier for object properties; this is the data type's only purpose.
