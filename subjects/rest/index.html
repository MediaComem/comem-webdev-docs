# REST APIs Introduction

## What is a Web Service?

How do they...
...find each other?
...know what logic can be invoked?
...talk to each other?

Image: clients <-> network <-> server (logic + data)

Remote services (RMI) in Java?

### Big web services

Approach
Services are often designed and developed with a RPC style (even if Document-Oriented Services are possible).

Core Standards
Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)
Web Services Description Language (WSDL)

Benefits
Very rich protocol stack (support for security, transactions, reliable transfer, etc.)

Problem
Very rich protocol stack (complexity, verbosity, incompatibility issues, theoretical human readability, etc.)

---
## RESTful web services

* REST: REpresentational State Transfer
* REST is an architectural style for building distributed systems.
* REST has been introduced in Roy Fielding’s Ph.D. thesis (Roy Fielding has been a contributor to the HTTP specification, to the apache server, to the apache community).
* The WWW is one example for a distributed system that exhibits the characteristics of a REST architecture.

---
### Principles of a REST architecture

* The state of the application is captured in a set of resources
  * Users, photos, comments, tags, albums, etc.
* Every resource is identified with a standard format (e.g. URL)
* Every resource can have several representations
* There is one unique interface for interacting with resources (e.g. HTTP methods)

---
### References

* Very good article, with presentation of key concepts and illustrative examples:
  http://www.infoq.com/articles/rest-introduction
* Suggestions for the design of “pragmatic APIs”
  http://www.vinaysahni.com/best-practices-for-a-pragmatic-restful-api

---
### HTTP is a protocol for interacting with **resources**

* At first glance, one could think that a resource is a file on a web server:
  * an HTML document, an XML document, a PNG document
* That fits the vision of the “static content” web
* But of course, the web is now more than a huge library of hypermedia documents:
  * through the web, we interact with services and a lot of the content is dynamic.
  * more and more, through the web we interact with physical objects (machines, sensors, actuators)
  * We need a more generic definition for resources!

---
### What is a resource?

* A resource is "something" that can be named and uniquely identified:
  * Example 1: an article published in the "24 heures" newspaper
  * Example 2: the collection of articles published in the sport section of the newspaper
  * Example 3: a person’s resume
  * Example 4: the current price of the Nestlé stock quote
  * Example 5: the vending machine in the school hallway
  * Example 6: the list of grades of the student Jean Dupont
* URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a mechanism for identifying resources
  * Example 1: http://www.24heures.ch/vaud/vaud/2008/08/04/trente-etudiants-partent-rencontre-patrons
  * Example 2: http://www.24heures.ch/articles/sport
  * Example 5: http://www.smart-machines.ch/customers/heig/machines/8272

---
### Resource vs. representation

* A "resource" can be something intangible (stock quote) or tangible (vending machine)
* The HTTP protocol supports the exchange of data between a client and a server.
* Hence, what is exchanged between a client and a server is not the resource. It is a representation of a resource.
* Different representations of the same resource can be generated:
  * HTML representation
  * XML representation
  * PNG representation
  * WAV representation

---
### HTTP provides the **content negotiation** mechanisms

```http
GET /books HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

[
  { "title": "Fahrenheit 451" }
]
```

```http
GET /article/game-of-thrones HTTP/1.1
Accept: */*
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html

<html>
  <head>
    <title>Game of Thrones</title>
  </head>
  <body>Awesome show!</body>
</html>
```

---
### Languages, platforms, communities

* Client vs. server...
* Frameworks...
* Full JavaScript...
* Specific tools we will use: node, express, mongodb, mongoose

---
## Testing tools

TODO: install postman

---
## CRUD

Create, read, update, delete

---
### Create

```http
POST /people HTTP/1.1
Content-type: application/json

{
  "name": {
    "first": "John",
    "last": "Doe"
  },
  "age": 24
}
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-type: application/json

{
  "_id": "3orv8nrg",
  "name": {
    "first": "John",
    "last": "Doe"
  },
  "age": 24
}
```

The POST method is used to request that the origin server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource identified by the Request URI.

HTTP 201 Created: The request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being created.

---
### Read

```http
GET /people HTTP/1.1
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: application/json

[
  { "_id": "3orv8nrg", … },
  { "_id": "a08un2fj", … }
]
```

The GET method means retrieve whatever information (in the form of an entity) is identified by the Request URI.

HTTP 200 OK: Standard response for successful HTTP requests. In a GET request, the response will contain an entity corresponding to the requested resource.

---
#### Collection resource vs. single resource

```http
GET /people/3orv8nrg HTTP/1.1
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: application/json

{
  "_id": "3orv8nrg",
  "name": {
    "first": "John",
    "last": "Doe"
  },
  "age": 24
}
```

---
### Update

```http
PUT /people/3orv8nrg HTTP/1.1
Content-type: application/json

{
  "name": {
    "first": "John",
    "last": "Smith"
  },
  "age": 34
}
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: application/json

{
  "_id": "3orv8nrg",
  "name": {
    "first": "John",
    "last": "Smith"
  },
  "age": 34
}
```

The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request URI. If the Request URI refers to an already existing resource, the enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a modified version of the one residing on the origin server.

HTTP 200 OK: In a PUT request, the response will contain an entity describing or containing the result of the action.

---
#### Partial updates with PATCH

TODO: partial update with PATCH example

---
### Delete

```http
DELETE /people/3orv8nrg HTTP/1.1
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Content-type: application/json
```

The DELETE method requests that the origin server delete the resource identified by the Request URI.

HTTP 204 No Content: The server successfully processed the request, but is not returning any content.
