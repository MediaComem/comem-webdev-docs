# Git Introduction

This is a condensed version of the first chapters of the [Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2), which you should read if you want more detailed information on the subject.

## What is version control?

> A system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

<br>

What can I do with it?

* **Revert** files back to a previous state.
* Revert the entire project back to a previous state.
* **Compare** changes over time.
* See who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more.
* **Recover** if you screw things up or lose files.

## A short history





---
### **Local** version control systems

.grid-60[

You can manually copy your files into another directory to keep old versions.

Systems such as [RCS][rcs] were developed to automate this process.

**But:**

* It is easy to forget which directory you’re in and accidentally write to the wrong file or copy over files you don’t mean to.
* This is limited to your computer: how do you **collaborate** with other people?

### **Centralized** version control systems

.grid-60[

Systems such as [CVS][cvs], [Subversion][svn], and [Perforce][perforce] have a **single server** that contains all the versioned files,
and clients check out files from that central place.

You can **collaborate** with other people through the server,
and administrators have **fine-grained control** over who can do what.

]
.container[

**But:**

* The centralized server is a **single point of failure**.
  If it goes down, then nobody can collaborate at all or save versioned change to anything they're working on.
* If the server's hard disk becomes corrupt and proper backups haven't been kept, you **lose the entire history** of the project except whatever single snapshots people happen to have on their local machines.


]
---
### **Distributed** version control systems

.grid-50[

Systems such as [Git][git], [Mercurial][mercurial], [Bazaar][bazaar] or [Darcs][darcs] are **distributed**.
Clients don't just check out the latest snapshot of the files: they **fully mirror** the repository.

* If any server dies, any of the client repositories can be copied back up to the server to **restore** it.
* You can **collaborate** with different groups of people in different ways simultaneously within the same project.
  This allows you to set up [several types of workflows][distributed-workflows] that aren't possible in centralized systems, such as hierarchical models.
