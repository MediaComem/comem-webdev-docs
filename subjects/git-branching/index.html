## What is branching?

> Branching means you diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without messing with that main line.

<p class='center'><img src='images/commits.png' width='45%' /></p>

Git has a very powerful branching model:

* Git branches are incredibly **lightweight**.
* Branching operations are nearly **instantaneous**.
* Switching between branches is generally just as **fast**.

Git encourages workflows that branch and merge often.





---
### Exercise

We will use this repository to illustrate branching:

```bash
$> cd /path/to/projects

$> git clone https://github.com/MediaComem/comem-webdev-git-branching-ex.git

$> cd comem-webdev-git-branching-exercise
```

Open the project with your favorite editor and open its `index.html` page in a browser.




---
## Working with branches

Remember that Git stores data as a series of snapshots.

<img src='images/snapshots.png' width='45%' />

Each **commit** contains a pointer to the snapshot of the content you staged, the author's user name and e-mail,
and also a pointer to the previous commit.





---
### What is a branch?

A branch is simply a lightweight, movable pointer to a commit.

<img src='images/branch.png' width='45%' />

The default branch is **master**.
The special **HEAD** pointer indicates the current branch.

As you start making commits, the current branch pointer **automatically moves** forward to your latest commit.

---
#### Showing branches on the command line

The `git log` command can show you a representation of the commit graph and its branches:

```bash
$> git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all
 * 4f94ga (HEAD -> master) Improve layout
 * 9ab3gd Fix addition
 * 387f12 First version
```

In fact, this command is so useful you should make an alias:

```bash
$> git config --global alias.graph "log --oneline --graph --decorate --all"

$> git graph
 * 4f94ga (HEAD -> master) Improve layout
 * 9ab3gd Fix addition
 * 387f12 First version
```

You can also use `git branch` to simply see the list of branches and which one you are currently on:

```bash
$> git branch
 * master
```

---
#### Why use branches?

Many teams using Git create a separate branch to develop each feature.
This has many advantages:

* Each developer can work on his own feature, **isolated** from changes going on elsewhere.
* They can pull in changes from the mainline **at their own pace**.
* The team can choose **which features to release** and when.





---
### Creating a new branch

> **Exercise:** Our JavaScript calculator is missing some code.
> Let's create a branch to implement subtraction.

It's very fast and simple to create a new branch:

```bash
$> git branch feature-2
```

<img src='images/new-branch.png' width='45%' />

There is now a new pointer to the current commit.
Note that **HEAD** didn't move â€“ we are still on the **master** branch.







---
### Switching branches

Now let's switch branches:

```bash
$> git checkout feature-2
Switched to branch 'feature-2'
```

<img src='images/checkout.png' width='45%' />

This moves `HEAD` to point to the `feature-2` branch.





---
### Commit on a branch

As you commit, the current branch (the one pointed to by **HEAD**), moves forward to the new commit.

```bash
$> git add subtract.js
$> git commit -m "Implement subtraction"
```

<img src='images/commit-on-branch.png' width='60%' />
